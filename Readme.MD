## Port Listener

I was having some trouble with connecting to my ArmBBS installation, over the web
today, so I needed something to listen to some ports.
I asked chatGPT to help me write it and this is what we came up with.
It seems to work pretty well, in terms of listening to connections on the ports
specified.

A possible next step would be to add more functionality to it, to make it 
possible to handle user input. Using Muffinterm leads to some errors at this
point, so there's some figuring out to do.
